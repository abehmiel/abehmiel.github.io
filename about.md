### Salutations. I’m Abe Hmiel.

I live in Manhattan and work as a data scientist at Quartet Health.

I’m a [Recurser](https://www.recurse.com/). My current interests include data science, machine learning, natural language processing, natural language understanding, category theory, twitter scraping and bots, and retro game development.

In my most recent professional position I was a data science consultant for Infosys Ltd. working onsite at a fortune 50 company in New York.

Before that, I was a postdoctoral research associate at The Institute of Shock Physics at Washington State University in Pullman. My projects focused on first-principles and molecular dynamics simulations in materials at high pressure and high temperature to extract physical quantities relevant to shock loading and static compression.

I graduated with a Ph. D. student in Nanoscience from The College of Nanoscale Science at SUNY Albany.

My Ph. D. research studied the effect of the electric field and variations in exchange-correlation on water-adsorbed metal oxide surfaces through first-principles quantum mechanics simulations. I was an active member of the UAlbany Future Faculty Leadership Council (FFLC) and the campus radio station WCDB.

I have a current music project called Holistic Wellness. I played guitar, bass, ukulele, sing, sequence drums and did other stuff for a solo music project called \_11:34 (underscore eleven thirty four) which was my primary vehicle for creative ideas for about six years. I also used to be in the bands Sonar Mellowship, The Cross Product, Carl Consumer and the Red White and Blue Torpedoes, Undefined Auguments, and Density of States.

I’m vegan, sober, ENM, and I like to ride bikes and do pistol squats.
